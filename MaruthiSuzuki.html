    <p>Maruti Suzuki India Limited, formerly known as Maruti Udyog Limited, is an Indian automobile manufacturer,
         based in New Delhi. It was founded in 1981 and owned by the Government of India until 2003, when it was 
         sold to the Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation.As of February 2022 Maruti Suzuki has a 
         market share of 44.2 percent in the Indian passenger car market
        

        <h2> History</h2>

<h3>Logo of Maruti Udyog</h3>
<p>Maruti Udyog Limited was founded by the Government of India on 24 Jan 1981 with Suzuki Motor Corporation as a
 minor partner, only to become the formal JV partner and license holder of Suzuki in August 2021.The first
  manufacturing factory of Maruti was established in Gurugram, Haryana, in the same year.</p>

  <h2>Chronology</h2>
  <h4>Affiliation with Suzuki</h4>
  <p>In 1982, a license and joint venture agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd., and Suzuki of Japan.
   At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an importer of cars. In India's closed market, Maruti received the right to
    import 2 fully built-up Suzuki in the first two years, and even after that, the early goal was to use only 33% 
    indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were some concerns that the Indian
     market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government
      even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales.Local 
      production commenced in December 1983 with the introduction of the SS30/SS40 Suzuki Fronte/Alto-based Maruti 
      800.In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released and the installed
       capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.
  </p>
  
 
  
  <h3>Joint venture related issues</h3>
 <p> Relationship between the Government of India, under the United Front (India) coalition and Suzuki Motor 
  Corporation over the joint venture was a point of heated debate in the Indian media until Suzuki Motor 
  Corporation gained the controlling stake. This highly profitable joint venture that had a near monopolistic 
  trade in the Indian automobile market and the nature of the partnership built up till then was the underlying 
  reason for most issues. The success of the joint venture led Suzuki to increase its equity from 26% to 40% in 
  1987, and to 50% in 1992, and further to 56.21% as of 2013.[20] In 1982, both the venture partners entered into
   an agreement to nominate their candidate for the post of Managing Director and every Managing Director would
    have a tenure of five years.</p>
  
 <h3>Manufacturing facilities</h3>
  <p>Maruti Suzuki has two manufacturing facilities in Haryana (Gurugram and Manesar), and one manufacturing complex 
  in Gujarat wholly-owned by parent company Suzuki which supplies its entire production to Maruti Suzuki. All
   manufacturing facilities have a combined production capacity of 2,250,000 vehicles annually (1.5 million 
   from Maruti Suzuki's two plants and 750,000 from Suzuki Motor Gujarat).
  
  The Gurugram manufacturing facility has three fully integrated manufacturing plants and is spread over 300 
  acres (1.2 km2).The Gurgaon facilities also manufacture 240,000 K-Series engines annually. The Gurugram
   facility manufactures the Alto 800, WagonR, Ertiga, XL6, S-Cross, Vitara Brezza, Ignis and Eeco. The Gurugram
    facility also assembles the Jimny starting from January 2021 solely for export markets. It was reported the 
    Indian-assembled Jimny will be exported to African markets and countries in the Middle East.
  
  
  
  In 2012, the company decided to merge Suzuki Powertrain India Limited (SPIL) with itself.SPIL was started
   as a JV by Suzuki Motor Corp. along with Maruti Suzuki. It has the facilities available for manufacturing diesel 
   engines and transmissions. The demand for transmissions for all Maruti Suzuki cars is met by the production from 
   SPIL.
  
  In 2017, the new Suzuki Motor Gujarat facility was opened. This third facility is not owned by Maruti Suzuki, 
  but instead wholly owned by Suzuki Motor Corporation. Despite that, the plant supplied vehicles to Maruti without
   any additional cost. Located in Hansalpur, Ahmedabad, the plant has a total annual capacity of 750,000 units.
  
  In November 2021 Maruti Suzuki announce to set up of a big plant in IMT Kharkhoda in Sonipat district across 900 
  acres with an investment of â‚¹18,000 crores.
